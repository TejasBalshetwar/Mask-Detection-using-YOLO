# Mask-Detection-using-YOLO
In this project I have used the YOLO (You Only Look Once) Algorithm for the detection of masks of people present in a image or video or also in a webcam feed.

I have implemented this project using OpenCV without GPU due to some limitations.

This project categorizes the given input into three categories:
1) None: People without Mask.
2) Bad : People who wore their mask below their noses.
3) Good : People wearing their mask properly.
